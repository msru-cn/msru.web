The Microsoft SharePoint connector is a [Palantir-provided driver](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/data-integration/foundry-provided-drivers/) for Microsoft SharePoint.

To create a new Microsoft SharePoint source, follow the [standard setup flow for Palantir-provided drivers](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/data-integration/foundry-provided-drivers/#setup), then use the sections below for Microsoft SharePoint-specific configuration and networking. For the complete property reference, see the [official Microsoft SharePoint driver documentation ↗](https://cdn.cdata.com/help/RSJ/jdbc/).

The table below lists the domains that the source needs to be able to access in order to successfully run.

For each domain, add a corresponding [egress policy](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/administration/configure-egress/). If the source is hosted on-premises and not directly reachable from Foundry, use an [agent proxy egress policy](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/administration/configure-egress/#agent-proxy-egress-policies) instead; the agent host itself must also be able to reach the listed domains. See [using an agent as a proxy](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/data-connection/agent-proxy/) for details.

| Domain | Required |
| --- | --- |
| <URL> | Always. URL connection property |
| <KerberosKDC>:88 | If `SharePointEdition='SharePoint OnPremise'` (default) AND `AuthScheme=Negotiate` |
| <KerberosServiceKDC>:88 | If `SharePointEdition='SharePoint OnPremise'` (default) AND `AuthScheme=Negotiate` AND Kerberos topology uses multiple realms |
| <SSOLoginURL> | If `SharePointEdition='SharePoint OnPremise'` (default) AND `AuthScheme=ADFS` |
| login.microsoftonline.com | If `SharePointEdition='SharePoint Online'` AND `AuthScheme=AzureAD,` AzurePassword, SharePointOAuth, OAuthJWT AND `AzureEnvironment=GLOBAL` (default) |
| login.chinacloudapi.cn | If `SharePointEdition='SharePoint Online'` AND `AuthScheme=AzureAD,` AzurePassword, SharePointOAuth, OAuthJWT AND `AzureEnvironment=CHINA` |
| login.microsoftonline.us | If `SharePointEdition='SharePoint Online'` AND `AuthScheme=AzureAD,` AzurePassword, SharePointOAuth, OAuthJWT AND `AzureEnvironment=USGOVT` or USGOVTDOD |
