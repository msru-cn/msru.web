Foundry Forms is no longer the recommended approach for data entry or writeback workflows on Foundry. Instead, build user input workflows with the Foundry Ontology, representing the relevant data structures as object types and configuring the writeback interaction with Actions. Learn more in the [Forms overview](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/forms/overview/) documentation.

In a form, simple fields ask for basic input from the respondent. This page discusses the different types of simple fields available in Foundry Forms, excluding [Attachments](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/forms/attachments-field/) fields.

## [](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/forms/simple-fields/#callout)Callout

The **callout** field highlights important content to the respondent and supports Markdown formatting. Users can configure the following options:

*   Create content that references the value of other fields.
*   Set a title, background color, and icon.
*   Add an image that has been uploaded to Foundry or other sites accessible from Foundry.

The value of a callout field will never write to the backing object type or spreadsheet. If you need to template some text with the value written in a different field, you can use the [template field](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/forms/auto-populating-fields/#template).

## [](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/forms/simple-fields/#checkboxes)Checkboxes

The **checkboxes** field displays a set of options as checkboxes. Users can configure the following options:

*   Provide a list of possible `Values` along with their displayed `Labels`.
*   Set `Default values`.
*   Display the checkboxes either horizontally or vertically.

## [](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/forms/simple-fields/#date-picker)Date picker

The **date picker** field allows respondents to enter a date or timestamp. Users can configure the following options:

*   Set a `Time Precision` (day, minute, second, or millisecond).
*   Set a `Recorded formt` (the default is `YYYY-MM-DD` for dates and `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZZ` for timestamps).
*   Enforce a minimum/maximum date.
*   Disable past/future dates.
*   Prefill the field with the date of filling.

The default minimum and maximum dates are 25 years from the current date but can be set further in the past or future by changing their configured values. For example, you could enable choosing a date of birth more than 25 years in the past by setting a minimum date in 1900.

In the date picker field, dates are always picked by and displayed to the user according to their timezone. However, when date values are written to the backing spreadsheet or object type, they are always written in UTC to be compatible across timezones.

*   Prefill the field if only one value is available.
*   Allow the creation of values other than the ones given.
*   Set a `Placeholder`.
*   Use the [Code Editor](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/forms/code-editor/) to set `noResultsText: string`.
