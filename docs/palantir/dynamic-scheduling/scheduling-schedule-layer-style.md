Schedule layers are rendered by default as "pucks" on the Gantt chart. These pucks can represent different concepts of your workflow and be customized to create a dynamic set of visualizations.

There are three ways to customize the appearance of your schedule layer (or "pucks"):

1.   **Puck Style**
2.   **Coloring**
3.   **Properties**

You can also select a **Puck style** to change the visual representation of the pucks in your schedule layer.

Selecting a **Puck style** allows you to change the visual representation of pucks in your layer. Three puck styles are available for configuration:

![Image 2: Schedule layer example styling.](https://www.palantir.com/docs/resources/foundry/dynamic-scheduling/schedule-layer-styling-2.png?width=700)
*   **Standard:**

    *   Standard styling renders a rectangular puck on your Gantt chart that can be interacted with via mouse interactions.
    *   Optionally, you can provide a puck height to determine the thickness of your puck. As this is backed by a Workshop variable, you can also expose this variable to end users and enable them to change the puck height on demand.
    *   Common uses of puck height include: 
        *   Using a "thin" puck to represent a status over time.
        *   Using a "thin" puck to represent a less important or secondary set of information.
        *   Using a "thick" puck to represent a "card" of information about the respective event.

*   **Background:**

    *   Background styling renders a slightly transparent puck on your Gantt chart that cannot be interacted with via mouse interactions.
    *   Background pucks do not support Rules.
    *   Common uses of background pucks include: 
        *   Using a background puck to represent availability (for example: green and red color-coded).
        *   Using a background puck to represent phases or statuses.
        *   Using a background puck to represent preferences.

*   **Event:**

    *   Event styling renders a point-in-time marker on the Gantt chart, representing a single timestamp rather than a time range.
    *   Event pucks do not support drag-and-drop or Rules.
    *   The following options are available: 
        *   **Is global:** When enabled, the event extends across all rows in the chart.
        *   **Always open:** When enabled, event flags are always expanded.
        *   **Icon:** Select a standard icon or a custom icon backed by a Media Reference property.

You can define the color definition for each schedule layer. Options include: **Static**, **Segmented by**, and **Conditional** coloring.

## [](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/dynamic-scheduling/scheduling-schedule-layer-style/#3-properties)3. Properties

For each schedule layer, you can define the properties from the ontology that will appear directly on the puck or on the popover card.

*   Popover properties:

    *   Select properties from your schedule layer's object, its linked objects, or use a function-backed property.
    *   You can choose to rename or remove the display name. Property formatting is configured alongside the property configuration in Ontology Manager.
    *   These properties will appear on the popover card. The popover card appears when a puck is hovered-over.

*   Puck properties:

    *   Select properties from your schedule layer's object, its linked objects, or use a function-backed property.
    *   You can choose to rename or remove the display name. Property formatting is configured alongside the property configuration in Ontology Manager.
    *   These properties will appear directly on the puck. If all selected properties cannot fit on the puck, you may need to adjust the height of your puck using the **Puck styling > Standard > Variable height** option described above.
