## Syntax and supported functions

For an orientation to the Expression board, see the [guide on using the expression board](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/contour/expressions-use-board/). This document is a resource for using Contour's rich expression language and can be used as a reference for types, operations and functions.

* * *

## Data types

You can use the following data types in expressions:

*   [String](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/contour/expressions-syntax/#string)
*   [Integer](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/contour/expressions-syntax/#integer)
*   [Double](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/contour/expressions-syntax/#double)
*   [Boolean](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/contour/expressions-syntax/#boolean)
*   [Date](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/contour/expressions-syntax/#date)

### String

Strings are expressed in single quotes:

`'This is a string'`

> This is a string

Escape single quotes within the string by adding a second single quote:

`'I''m a string'`

> I’m a string

Concatenate columns as strings with the `||` operator:

`"Gender" || "MaritalStatus"`

You can also concatenate columns with constants.

`'$' || ("salaryColumn"/1000.0) || 'k'`

### Integer

Integers are non-floating point numbers:

`5`

### Double

Doubles are floating point numbers:

`5.7`

### Boolean

Boolean variables can be either `true` or `false`. Boolean variables are case-insensitive.

### Date

You can cast strings in the format YYYY-MM or YYYY-MM-DD as dates:

`CAST('2016-12-06' AS DATE)`

You can also cast strings as timestamps:

`CAST('2016-12-06` `01:12:34' AS TIMESTAMP)`

When performing operations with timestamps, it is easiest to first cast the timestamp to a long, or to a double if you need millisecond precision. This gives you the number of seconds in UNIX time.

For example, say you have two timestamp columns: “start” and “end.” To determine the number of minutes between the two times, you can use the following expression:

`(CAST("end" as LONG) - CAST("start" as LONG)) / 60`.

Casting longs to timestamps assumes that that long values are in seconds. If your data is in milliseconds, divide by 1000 prior to casting.

* * *

## Operations

The following sections give an overview over the operations that you can use in expressions and their precedence:

*   [Arithmetic](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/contour/expressions-syntax/#arithmetic)
*   [Comparison](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/contour/expressions-syntax/#comparison)
*   [Equality comparison](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/contour/expressions-syntax/#equality-comparison)
*   [Boolean comparison](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/contour/expressions-syntax/#boolean-comparison)
*   [Casting](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/contour/expressions-syntax/#casting)
*   [Case/When/End](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/contour/expressions-syntax/#casewhenend)
*   [Like](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/contour/expressions-syntax/#like)
*   [Null checks](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/contour/expressions-syntax/#null-checks)
*   [Precedence](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/contour/expressions-syntax/#precedence)

### Arithmetic

Add, subtract, multiply, and divide numeric columns (integers or doubles) by other numeric columns or by constants: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`

*   `"tipAmount" / "fare"`
*   `"diameter" * 3.14`

### Comparison

Compare columns of any type against each other and against constants with `>` (greater than), `>=` (greater than or equal to), `<` (less than), `<=` (less than or equal to). Results in a column of booleans.

*   `"age" > "averageAge"`
*   `"totalDistance" < 5`

### Equality comparison

Check whether a row has the _same_ value in two columns with `==`, or _different_ values with `!=`.

*   `"cityOfBirth" == "cityOfResidence"`

You can also compare column values with constants.

*   `"Gender" == 'M'`

String comparisons

When comparing two strings, lexicographical ordering is used. Note that this can be counterintuitive when comparing strings that contain numbers. For example:

*   `'Alligator' < 'Boat'` => TRUE because the encoding of 'A' is less than that of 'B'
*   `'Alliance' < 'Alligator'` => TRUE because 'a' is less than 'g'
*   `'Zoo' < 'alpha'` => TRUE because 'Z' is less than 'a'
*   `'Zoo' < 'Zoologist'` => TRUE because if one string is the prefix of the other, the shorter one is considered to be lesser
*   `'1' < '2'` => TRUE because the string character '1' is less than the string character '2'
*   `'10' < '2'` => TRUE because its first string character '1' is less than the string character '2'; note that this is a comparison of the strings '10' and '2', not the integers 10 and 2
*   `'10' < '20'` => TRUE because '1' is less than '2'

Behavior differences with Spark SQL

In the Contour expression language, equality comparisons with `NULL` have the below behavior.

*   `NULL = 'DATA'` => FALSE
*   `NULL != 'DATA'` => TRUE
*   `NULL = NULL` => TRUE
*   `NULL != NULL` => FALSE

However, in Spark SQL, all of these expressions return `NULL`. When translating between Contour expressions and Spark SQL, it is important to consider this difference in behavior in order to produce consistent results.

### Boolean comparison

Derive a new column of booleans by evaluating one or more columns with boolean logic.

*   `"Age" >=70 AND "Gender" = 'M'`

### Casting

Casting lets you change the type of a column or expression. You can cast to booleans, integers, doubles, dates, and timestamps.

*   `CAST("startDate" AS DATE)`
*   `CAST("startTime" AS TIMESTAMP)`
*   `CAST("numParticipants" AS INTEGER)`

### Case/When/End

Case statements let you evaluate multiple possibilities in one expression. Each statement is evaluated in order, and the `THEN` statement is executed for the first one to evaluate to true.

Copied!

```
1CASE
2    WHEN "age" < 13 THEN 'Child'
3    WHEN "age" > 19 THEN 'Adult'
4    ELSE 'Teenager'
5END
```

Copied!

```
1CASE MaritalStatus
2    WHEN 'S' THEN 'Single'
3    WHEN 'M' THEN 'Married'
4    ELSE 'Unknown'
5END
```

### Like

Search for a specified pattern in a column. See the documentation on [SQL LIKE ↗](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_like.asp) to learn more.

### Null Checks

Check whether a value `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL`. Returns a boolean.

### Precedence

The precedence of operations within expressions is detailed in the following list, from highest precedence to the lowest. Operations that are on the same line all have the same precedence.

1.   +, -, NOT (unary)
2.   || (binary)
3.   *, /, % (binary)
4.   +, - (binary)
5.   <, <=, >, >= (binary)
6.   =, ==, !=, <>, IS, IS NOT, LIKE, RLIKE (binary)
7.   IS NULL, NOT NULL (unary)
8.   IN, NOT IN
9.   AND (binary)
10.   OR (binary)

Warning

When using `ROW_NUMBER`, `FIRST`, `LAST`, `ARRAY_AGG`, or `ARRAY_AGG_DISTINCT`, in a window function, be careful of nondeterminism. Imagine we are partitioning by column A and ordering by column B. If for the same value of column A, there are multiple rows with the same value of column B, the results of these window functions may be non-deterministic -- they may produce different results given the same input data and logic.

### Window functions

Window functions need an OVER clause; more info and examples in the [reference documentation on window functions](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/contour/expressions-window-functions/).

*   FIRST: Returns the first value in a group.
*   LAG: Returns the value that is arg1 rows before the current row in column arg0, and null if there are less than arg1 rows before the current row. For example, an arg1 of one will return the previous row at any given point in the window partition (note: arg1 must be an integer literal).
*   LAST: Returns the last value in a group.
*   LEAD: Returns the value that is arg1 rows after the current row in column arg0, and null if there are less than arg1 rows after the current row. For example, an arg1 of one will return the next row at any given point in the window partition (note: arg1 must be an integer literal).
*   NTILE: Returns the ntile group id (from 1 to arg0 inclusive) in an ordered window partition. For example, if arg0 is 4, the first quarter of the rows will get value 1, the second quarter will get 2, the third quarter will get 3, and the last quarter will get 4 (note: arg0 must be an integer literal).
*   PERCENT_RANK: Returns the relative rank (i.e. percentile) of rows within a window partition.
