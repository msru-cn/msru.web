As discussed in the overview for [datasets](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/data-integration/datasets/), unstructured data in Foundry is stored as a collection of files in a dataset just like tabular data.

These are some features that work identically between pipelines on structured and unstructured data:

*   Pipelines can be made incremental to optimize compute performance.
*   You can write unit tests against your pipelines.
*   Computing output datasets is done using [builds](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/data-integration/builds/) and [schedules](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/building-pipelines/scheduling-overview/).
*   Foundry's [pipeline security](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/building-pipelines/security-overview/) features enable robust, end-to-end security guarantees.

Some differences from pipelines on tabular data include:

*   Most guidance and example code in documentation focuses on processing dataframes, which are not the input types used for unstructured data.
*   You must use the lower-level file system APIs to read and write files in unstructured datasets.
*   Because unstructured datasets have no schema, some features focused on validating rows and columns of tabular datasets are unavailable.
*   It is possible to use Spark to process unstructured files in parallel, but the APIs are lower-level and more complex than for dataframe processing.

To get started with pipelines on unstructured data, refer to the relevant parts of documentation for Python and Java transforms:

*   [Python transforms: Read and write unstructured files](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/transforms-python/unstructured-files/)
*   [Java transforms: Read and write unstructured files](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/transforms-java/unstructured-files/)

Once unstructured data has been cleaned and normalized, you can use [Code Workbook](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/code-workbook/overview/) to analyze unstructured datasets and train machine learning models in Python and R.
